      title: "The Object-Oriented Paradigm"
      questions:
        - How did each file change above by converting the <code>Vehicle</code> interface to a class?
        - By converting the <code>Vehicle</code> interface to a class, what can we now define in a <code>Vehicle</code> that we could not define in the <code>interface</code>?
        - You can implement an <code>interface</code>; what is the keyword to subclass a class?
        - From context, what do you think the abstract keyword means in the <code>Vehicle</code> class?
        - From context, what do you think the call to <code>super()</code> does?
        - Notice that some elements are scoped to be <code>public</code> and <code>private</code>, like before, but now some items are <code>protected</code>.  Which items are <code>protected</code>, and in which files do they reside?  What do you think this scope allows/disallows?
