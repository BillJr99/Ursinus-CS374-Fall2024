The purpose of this assignment is to explore the functional programming paradigm in Scheme.

## Preparation

If you have not already, install scheme on your computer.  If you can type `scheme` and hit Enter, and see Scheme load, you are ready to proceed.  If you need to install Scheme on Ubuntu, you can execute this command:

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install mit-scheme`

or install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on the mac, and run this command from the Mac terminal:

`brew install mit-scheme`

Alternatively, you can use a web-based IDE such as [repl.it](https://repl.it).

When you run `scheme`, you'll be presented with an interpreter where you can write or paste code directly, or use the following command to load a file (here, called `myfile.scm`, from your current directory (from which you started scheme):

`(load "myfile.scm")`

Finally, you can clone this git repository that provides a `scheme.py` Python interpreter: `git clone https://github.com/BillJr99/scheme-interpreter.git`.  You can run it via `python scheme.py myfile.scm`.

## Part 1: Warmup with Lambda Procedures

Using `lambda`, define a procedure that computes a value on a line according to the classic formula:

<span>\\(y = mx + b\\)</span><br>

## Part 2: Warmup with Anonymous Lambda Procedures

Define an anonymous or secondary lambda procedure to compute the discriminant of a quadratic function:

<span>\\(x1, x2 = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}\\)</span><br>

Specificaly, your anonymous lambda should compute:

<span>\\(b^{2} - 4ac\\)</span><br>

And you can compose and return a list from your main lambda procedure that adds to, and subtracts from, the discriminant to obtain your two roots.  

For your convenience, you may wish to also calculate the square root of the discriminant within this anonymous procedure (and you should feel free to do so!):

<span>\\(\sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}\\)</span><br>

Note that the `sqrt` function is built into Scheme, so you can `(sqrt x)` for some expression `x`.

### What to Do

Begin by writing the quadratic formula as a function that calls subfunctions.  Define each of these functions.  For example, you might have `quadratic` call `discriminant` and `plusminus`.  `discriminant` computes the discriminant, and `plusminus` returns a list of values consisting of `a + b` and `a - b` for paramaters `a` and `b`.  Note that when dividing a list of values by a scalar (i.e., dividing the `plusorminus` by `2 * a`, you'll need a function that dividies a list of two items by a scalar.  The division operator does not do this natively.  Here is a function you can use for this purpose:

```scheme
(define div2 (lambda (L x)
   (list (/ (car L) x) (/ (car (cdr L)) x))
))
```

Test this function by calling `quadratic` with example values.  Then, modify your program by replacing each function call with the `lambda` of the function (i.e., everything inside the `define` statement).  Repeat this process until you have no more function calls, but only anonymous inner `lambda` statements.  You should have a one-line main function that composes all your lambdas together!  Run this, and you should obtain the same results as before. 

## Part 3: Mapping

Using an anonymous `lambda` procedure, create a `map` that applies your anonymous `lambda` to two lists.  `map` works like this:

```
(map <your lambda procedure> '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6))
```

Your lambda procedure could be a function or an operator like `*` (which, if used in combination with `+` below, gives you the dot product of two vectors!).

This map will apply your lambda procedure to each pair of items in the list (1 and 4, 2 and 5, and 4 and 6).  Your `lambda` should accept, then, two parameters.  Modify this map to multiply each pair of items together.

Next, you can use `apply` to reduce this list.  Prepend the following (and balnace the parentheses on the right) to compute the dot product of the two lists by adding together all the items in the resulting list:

```
(apply + <your map here>)
```

## Part 4: Working with Lists

Write a `lambda` procedure called `czr` which returns the last item in the list.  If the `cdr` of the list is `null`, then you have found the last item: otherwise, you can recurse into `czr` on the `cdr` of the list until the last item is found.

Write a second `lambda` function called `cxr` that returns everything **except** the last item in the list.  Note that `cxr` is the `cdr` of the reverse of a list, reversed again.  Here is a `reverse-list` function that you can use:

```scheme
(define reverse-helper (lambda (remaining reversed)
    (if (null? remaining)
        reversed
        (reverse-helper (cdr remaining) (cons (car remaining) reversed))
	)
))

(define reverse-list (lambda (lst)
  (reverse-helper lst '())
))
```
