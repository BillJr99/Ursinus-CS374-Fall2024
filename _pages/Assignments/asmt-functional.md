      beginning: The algorithm fails on the test inputs due to one or more minor issues
      progressing: The algorithm is implemented to solve the problem correctly according to given test inputs, but would fail if executed in a general case due to a minor issue or omission in the algorithm design or implementation

      beginning: Code commenting and structure is limited in ways that reduce the readability of the program, and/or there are minor departures from the style guide
      progressing: Code documentation is present that re-states the explicit code definitions, and/or code is written that mostly adheres to the style guide

      proficient: The program is submitted according to the directions, including a readme writeup describing the solution, and thoughtful answers to the bolded questions throughout

The purpose of this assignment is to explore the functional programming paradigm in Scheme.

## Preparation

If you have not already, install scheme on your computer.  If you can type `scheme` and hit Enter, and see Scheme load, you are ready to proceed.  If you need to install Scheme on Ubuntu, you can execute this command:

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install mit-scheme`

or install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on the mac, and run this command from the Mac terminal:

`brew install mit-scheme`

Alternatively, you can use a web-based IDE such as [repl.it](https://repl.it).

When you run `scheme`, you'll be presented with an interpreter where you can write or paste code directly, or use the following command to load a file (here, called `myfile.scm`, from your current directory (from which you started scheme):

`(load "myfile.scm")`

Finally, you can clone this git repository that provides a `scheme.py` Python interpreter: `git clone https://github.com/vladimirfomene/scheme-interpreter.git`.  You can run it via `python scheme.py myfile.scm`.

## Part 1: Warmup with Lambda Procedures

Using `lambda`, define a procedure that computes a value on a line according to the classic formula:

<span>\\(y = mx + b\\)</span><br>

## Part 2: Warmup with Anonymous Lambda Procedures

Define an anonymous or secondary lambda procedure to compute the discriminant of a quadratic function:

<span>\\(x1, x2 = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}\\)</span><br>

Specificaly, your anonymous lambda should compute:

<span>\\(\sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}\\)</span><br>

And you can compose and return a list from your main lambda procedure that adds to, and subtracts from, the discriminant to obtain your two roots.

## Part 3: Mapping

Using an anonymous `lambda` procedure, create a `map` that applies your anonymous `lambda` to two lists.  `map` works like this:

```
(map <your lambda procedure> '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6))
```

This map will apply your lambda procedure to each pair of items in the list (1 and 4, 2 and 5, and 4 and 6).  Your `lambda` should accept, then, two parameters.  Modify this map to multiply each pair of items together.

Next, you can use `apply` to reduce this list.  Prepend the following (and balnace the parentheses on the right) to compute the dot product of the two lists by adding together all the items in the resulting list:

```
(apply + <your map here>)
```

## Part 4: Working with Lists

Write a `lambda` procedure called `czr` which returns the last item in the list.  If the `cdr` of the list is `null`, then you have found the last item: otherwise, you can recurse into `czr` on the `cdr` of the list until the last item is found.

Write a second `lambda` function called `cxr` that returns everything **except** the last item in the list.  You may write or find (and cite) a procedure to reverse a list, and note that `cxr` is the `cdr` of the reverse of a list, reversed again.

You can append two lists together as follows (where `'(1 2 3)` and `'(4 5 6)` are lists that can also be variables or recursive function calls that return lists!  The result is `(1 2 3 4 5 6)`):

```
(append (list 1 2 3) (list 4 5 6))
```
